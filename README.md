[From Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mothman)

<blockquote>
In West Virginia folklore, the Mothman is a creature reportedly seen in the Point Pleasant area from November 12, 1966, to December 15, 1967. The first newspaper report was published in the Point Pleasant Register dated November 16, 1966, titled "Couples See Man-Sized Bird ... Creature ... Something".[1] The national press soon picked up the reports and helped spread the story across the United States.

## The Mapping Mothman Project

Mapping Mothman aims to be the first application of its kind, allowing users from all over the world to submit details of their alleged sightings and / or encounters with The Mothman.

Mapping Mothman catalogues and compares user submitted Mothman data, and provides a platform for witnesses, experts, and enthusiasts to connect.

The project currently consists of a Node / Express / MongoDB back-end, and a React front-end, using the Google Maps API to plot Mothman markers.
